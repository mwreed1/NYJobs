## Data availability

The primary dataset we have chosen to use is the [NYC Jobs](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs) from data.gov. The data-set 
contains data from jobs listings around NYC. The data is collected from the City 
of New York's official jobs website [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/jobs/index.page). 
The data was first published January 8th 2020, and was most recently updated 
October 25th, 2022. The NYC OpenData project maintains the data. The data is 
available for download via csv. Thus, we intend to download the csv file and 
upload it directly into R.
