The data-set contains data from jobs listings around NYC. The data is collected from the City of New York’s official jobs website here. The data was first published January 8th 2020, and was most recently updated October 25th, 2022. The NYC OpenData project maintains the data. The data is available for download via csv. Thus, we intend to download the csv file and upload it directly into R. There are two reasons that we chose this dataset: Firstly, the data was easily downloadable in a form that could be imported directly into R with little pre-processing. Secondly, it had several variables that we could explore the relationship between.There are many interesting things to discover, such as what categories have the most jobs, what kinds of jobs tend to have a higher salary, whether a higher leveljob has a higher salary, which location tends to pay more.
