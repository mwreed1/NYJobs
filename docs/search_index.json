[["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data exploration", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data exploration In order to explore our data, we first wanted to look at the distribution of different job postings by category. Based on this plot, engineering jobs clearly are the most prolific, with human resources and legal also being common in the NYC job board. The least common job postings by far are administrative support. Next, we wanted to see what sort of factors impacted the salary range of a job. Technology and data appeared to have the highest average salary potential at around 150k USD Administrative support had the lowest average salary potential at around 50k USD. The ‘other’ category had the largest salary range, which makes sense because it is a miscellaneous category with several possible job types. Next we looked at the salary ranges of the different posting agencies. The Municipal Water Fin Authority posted jobs with the highest average salary potential, at around 140k USD. The Business Integrity Commission posted jobs with the lowest average salary potential, around 55k USD. Next we looked into how a job’s career level impacted its salary. The data shows that executives make the most on average and entry-level positions make the least. This trend makes sense with what we know about career levels. Next we looked into how a job’s level impacted its salary. We split the level into three categories based on the code given to the level. The levels that started with M had the highest average salary potentials, while the levels that started with numbers tended to be associated with lower average salary potentials. The level with the highest average salary potential is MY. In fact, the lower end of the salary range is higher than the higher end of any other level’s average salary range. After looking at the different factors that influenced salary range, we wanted to see if the salaries of jobs posted changed over time. In order to do so, we only looked at the lower end of the salary ranges for each job posted in our data set. While there does not appear to be a huge change over time, job salaries seemed to peak around 2021. When focusing on 2022, it seems as though salaries peaked around August. ## # A tibble: 5,630 × 33 ## job_id agency posti…¹ numbe…² busin…³ civil…⁴ title…⁵ title…⁶ level job_c…⁷ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 552809 OFFICE … Intern… 1 Deputy… DIRECT… Non-Co… 95612 MY Financ… ## 2 552809 OFFICE … Extern… 1 Deputy… DIRECT… Non-Co… 95612 MY Financ… ## 3 527960 OFFICE … Intern… 1 Head, … DIRECT… Non-Co… 95612 MY Financ… ## 4 527960 OFFICE … Extern… 1 Head, … DIRECT… Non-Co… 95612 MY Financ… ## 5 549704 FIRE DE… Intern… 1 First … FIRST … Exempt… 13003 M8 Commun… ## 6 562664 DEPARTM… Extern… 1 Genera… EXECUT… Non-Co… 95005 M8 Legal … ## 7 562664 DEPARTM… Intern… 1 Genera… EXECUT… Non-Co… 95005 M8 Legal … ## 8 549704 FIRE DE… Extern… 1 First … FIRST … Exempt… 13003 M8 Commun… ## 9 561950 LAW DEP… Intern… 1 FIRST … FIRST … Exempt… 30140 M8 Legal … ## 10 561950 LAW DEP… Extern… 1 FIRST … FIRST … Exempt… 30140 M8 Legal … ## # … with 5,620 more rows, 23 more variables: ## # full_time_part_time_indicator &lt;chr&gt;, career_level &lt;chr&gt;, ## # salary_range_from &lt;dbl&gt;, salary_range_to &lt;dbl&gt;, salary_frequency &lt;chr&gt;, ## # work_location &lt;chr&gt;, division_work_unit &lt;chr&gt;, job_description &lt;chr&gt;, ## # minimum_qual_requirements &lt;chr&gt;, preferred_skills &lt;chr&gt;, ## # additional_information &lt;chr&gt;, to_apply &lt;chr&gt;, hours_shift &lt;chr&gt;, ## # work_location_1 &lt;chr&gt;, recruitment_contact &lt;lgl&gt;, … "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
