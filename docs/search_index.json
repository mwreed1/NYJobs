Ultimately, we aim to take advantage of sophisticated visualization tools to display all the critical information and the rules they’re playing. Another potential factor worth exploring is the pandemic happening throughout the past few years. Hence we will make our analysis and output reproducible to keep monitoring its short-term and long-term effects on how the labor industries are affected. Job postings on the City of New York’s official jobs site will serve as the data source. 2.2 Data availability The primary data set we have chosen to use is the NYC Jobs from data.gov.
