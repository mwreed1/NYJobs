Various job features are provided, including “Business title”, “Agency”, “number of positions”, “job category”, “Full time/Part time”, “Salary Range”, and so on. We deploy different kinds of EDA methods to comprehend this data. In particular, our interest lies in how the labour market has been behaving in the recent few years in NYC while the pandemic is still around, in terms of how different jobs are paid and the corresponding trend. There are many interesting things to discover, such as what categories have the most jobs, what kinds of jobs tend to have a higher salary, whether a higher leveljob has a higher salary, which location tends to pay more.It could be a guide to job seekers showing what positions are more suitable in today’s market. In addition, we would love to present the information and results not using boring numbers but visualizations such as bars, dot plots and interactive graphs. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic In this project, we focus on how various jobs are paid differently in New York City by analyzing internal features, including related industries, position levels, geographical locations, residence requirements etc. Studying how these features are correlated and have different significance levels on the output salaries will facilitate our understanding of the labor market structure of NYC and help job seekers know what positions are statistically better suited and paid. Ultimately, we aim to take advantage of sophisticated visualization tools to display all the critical information and the rules they’re playing. Another potential factor worth exploring is the pandemic happening throughout the past few years. Hence we will make our analysis and output reproducible to keep monitoring its short-term and long-term effects on how the labor industries are affected. Job postings on the City of New York’s official jobs site will serve as the data source. 2.2 Data availability The primary data set we have chosen to use is the NYC Jobs from data.gov. The data-set contains data from jobs listings around NYC. The data is collected from the City of New York’s official jobs website here. The data was first published January 8th 2020, and was most recently updated October 25th, 2022. The NYC OpenData project maintains the data. The data is available for download via csv. Thus, we intend to download the csv file and upload it directly into R. There are two reasons that we chose this dataset: Firstly, the data was easily downloadable in a form that could be imported directly into R with little pre-processing. Secondly, it had several variables that we could explore the relationship between.There are many interesting things to discover, such as what categories have the most jobs, what kinds of jobs tend to have a higher salary, whether a higher leveljob has a higher salary, which location tends to pay more. A brief explanation to some of the columns: Agency: Name of the New York City agency (“agency” or “hiring agency”) where a job vacancy exists. Posting Type: Identifies whether a job posting is an Internal or External posting. Internal postings are available to City employees only and external postings are available to the general public. Job Category: Broad Classification of where all the jobs would fall in. Full-time/Part-Time: Time frame of a job. Salary Range From: The beginning salary cap for that particular opening. Salary Range To: The highest cap for that particular job opening. Salary Frequency: The payment factor for the job, hourly or annual. Work Location: The location of the workplace. Job Description: A brief idea of what the job will contain. Minimum Qual Requirements: The minimum qualifications a candidate must possess for the job. Preferred Skills: Optimal skills which the posting is looking for.

Then we made some simplified variables, so that analysis was not so complicated. These variables included job category, agency, and job level. We had to transform the dates into a form that R would recognize. Finally, we made a new variable based on if a job posting had required skills or not. 3.3 Missing value analysis ## Recruitment Contact Post Until Hours/Shift ## 5630 3917 3795 ## Work Location 1 Additional Information Preferred Skills ## 3305 1172 871 ## Full-Time/Part-Time indicator Minimum Qual Requirements Job Category ## 215 64 2 ## Career Level To Apply Job ID ## 2 1 0 ## Agency Posting Type # Of Positions ## 0 0 0 ## Business Title Civil Service Title Title Classification ## 0 0 0 ## Title Code No Level Salary Range From ## 0 0 0 ## Salary Range To Salary Frequency Work Location ## 0 0 0 ## Division/Work Unit Job Description Residency Requirement ## 0 0 0 ## Posting Date Posting Updated Process Date ## 0 0 0 It seems that the most common missing variable is recruitment_contact, with hours_shift and post_until also being quite common. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data exploration 4.2 Salary analysis 4.3 Required skills", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Data exploration In order to explore our data, we first wanted to look at the distribution of different job postings by category. Based on this plot, engineering jobs clearly are the most prolific, with human resources and legal also being common in the NYC job board. The least common job postings by far are administrative support. Next we want to see the posting type and Full-Time/Part-Time type for different catogories. We can find that for all the different categories, there are more internal jobs than external jobs, and almost all the jobs all full time, there are few part time jobs. 4.2 Salary analysis Next, we wanted to see what categories of jobs have the highest starting salary. Based on the scatter plot, we can see that Engineering seems to have the highest starting salary, Public Safety and Building Operations seems to have the lowest starting salary. Legal and Finance have the largest starting salary variance.We can also find that there are many extremely low starting salary, and we try to find that all of these points’ career level are students, maybe many jobs give student only a small amount of salary. Next, we wanted to see what sort of factors impacted the salary range of a job. Technology and data appeared to have the highest average salary potential at around 150k USD Administrative support had the lowest average salary potential at around 50k USD. The ‘other’ category had the largest salary range, which makes sense because it is a miscellaneous category with several possible job types. Next we looked at the salary ranges of the different posting agencies. The Municipal Water Fin Authority posted jobs with the highest average salary potential, at around 140k USD. The Business Integrity Commission posted jobs with the lowest average salary potential, around 55k USD. Next we looked into how a job’s level impacted its salary. We split the level into three categories based on the code given to the level. The levels that started with M had the highest average salary potentials, while the levels that started with numbers tended to be associated with lower average salary potentials. The level with the highest average salary potential is MY. In fact, the lower end of the salary range is higher than the higher end of any other level’s average salary range. Next we want to see the average starting salary by career level. It seems that Student have the lowest salary, and executive have the highest salary, and executive has the largest salary range. Then we want to see if there is any relationship between level and career level. According to the plot, we can see that job level is highly related to career_level, for example, student only can take low level job, from 00 to 02, Entry_level tend to take 00-04 and M1 jobs; Executive tend to take high level jobs from M3 to MY; and Experienced seems to have a high range level of jobs. After looking at the different factors that influenced salary range, we wanted to see if the salaries of jobs posted changed over time. In order to do so, we only looked at the lower end of the salary ranges for each job posted in our data set. While there does not appear to be a huge change over time, job salaries seemed to peak around 2021. When focusing on 2022, it seems as though salaries peaked around August. 4.3 Required skills Here we looked into whether or not a job posting requires specific skills. As the seniority increases, so does the percentage of postings that require previous skills. This makes sense based on what we expected.

Firstly, We have discovered that Engineering, Human Resources and Law-related industries have the most available positions for employees. Secondly, Technological, Financial, and Engineering companies tend to offer the highest salary on average. Also, most posting jobs require specific skills regardless of positions and industries. There are also limitations to our report. For example, the dataset only includes jobs provided by the City of New York’s official job site, not covering private organizations and companies such as private schools or restaurants. Another issue is that most data available are from 2022, which prevents us from analyzing the overall effect of the pandemic. Plus, the labour market is versatile, so the results hold little prediction accuracy for the future. Therefore, we must keep monitoring the job posting conditions along with time. Completing a full exploratory data analysis has helped us deploy various visualizations more flexibly and fluently. However, we have learnt that cleaning and transforming the raw dataset could be a highly challenging problem. Also, We should keep improving the graphs to make them more accessible and comprehensible to non-professionals.
